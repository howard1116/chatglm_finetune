1.Introductiot
With increasingly restrictive volatile organic compound dischar-
ging, water-based coatings, adhesives, and leather finishing have been
rapidly developed. Two-component waterborme polyurethane has
gained an important place in these applications because of its excellent
physical and chemical properties [1]. Two-component waterborne
polyurethane consists of hydroxyl component and an isocyanate com-
functionalization characteristics such as flame-retardance, non-toxicity

and weather resistance in previous research [24]. Therefore, it is im-

with different crystalline forms (anatase, rutile and brookite) could
cause different properties in the system [12]. The rutile TiO is the most

has a needlelike structure, which prejudices dispersion during pre

In this paper, we prepared a series of hydroxyl components with

2.2.Method
100.0 g PPG, 27.0 g OP550, 41.8 g IPDI and nanoTIO, were added
into four flasks with a condenser pipe at 80°C for 23h. We then added
9.9 g DMPA and some acetone for 12 h. Subsequently, the temperature
was cooled to 40 °C. Next, 9.9 g TEA was added to four fasks at 40°C
for 30 min. The polyurethane prepolymer was mixed with 376.0 g
deionozed water at high-speed shear mixing for 30 min. Final, the
polyurethane polyol dispersion (TOPUD) was removed with acetone at
40 °C rotary evaporation for 2 h. The synthesis is displayed in Scheme 1.
Six different TOPUD samples were prepared, with various nanoTiO
content of 0 (for control experiment) 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 wt.%.
These samples were named as TOPUD-x, with *x* representing the
nanoTiO, content. We added a hydrophilic curing agent (the stoichio.
metric ratio of  NCO to  OH was 1.6) into the emulsion with 0.3 g
antifoaming agent, 0.45 g weting agent and 0.75 g flow control agent.
The reaction was under ultrasonic vibration for 30 min, waiting for a
complex reaction. The ultima emulsion was two-component waterborne
polyurethane (TOWPU). Six diferent TOWPU samples were prepared,
with various nanoTiO content of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 wt.% The

2.3. Characterization
The grain size and zeta potential of the hydrophilic curing agent and
TOWPU emulsion were laser particle sized at 25 °C for 120 s with a laser
particle size instrument (Malvem Zetasizer Nano ZS90). The hydro-
philic curing agent and TowPU emulsion were diluted to 1 wt% by
deionized water. The viscosity of hydrophilic curing agent and TOWPU
rotor was zero size at 34 s~2 at 25 °C. A transmission electron micro-
were tested by Brookfield programmable DV-II + Pro Viscometer. The
scope (Hitachi H-s00 TEM) was used to observe the surface morphology
of emulsion particles. The TOWPU emulsion were diluted to 1 wt% by
mixed solvent (the molar ratio of absolute ethyl alcohol and deionized
water was 1:1), and then dropped into a copper mesh to wait for dry at
room temperature.
The TOWPU was cut to 25mm × 25emm × 2mm quartz plate and
then placed into a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The Nicolet

TOWPU films were tested through an electronic and mechanical testing
machine (AGS-J electronic and mechanical testing machine, Japan

and the average value is reported. The thermal degeneration TOWPU
films and char yield of TOwPU coatings were tested by thermogravi-
metric analysis (Switzerland Mettler TGA/DSC differential thermal

to 500 °C at a warming speed 10 °C/min. The samples were dried at
80 °C for 24 h. The gaseous product of thermal degeneration of TOWPU

The resicue was mixed with dried KBr and then pressed into tablets.
The limiting oxygen index (LOI) of TOwPU was determined using the
digital display oxygen index apparatus LFY606 B (China Shandong
textile academy of sciences institute of instrument) according to the
combustion performance of the oxygen index standard test ASTM
D2863-77 by LFY606 B digital display oxygen index apparatus
(Shandong Academy of Sciences). The TOWPU films were cut to
150 mm × 50 mm splines (each sample had five strips). UL-94 of

char residues under a 15 kV accelerating voltage. The char residues of
the TOPWU- films were warmed at 500 °C in a tube furnace. The U.
3010 Hitachi ultraviolet-visible (UVvis) spectrophotometer was used
to test the films of quartz plates by scanning between 200 and 800 nm.
The TOWPU were spun on a 25.6 mm × 72.4 mm × 2 mm glass slide
and then dried in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C for 12h. The trans-
mission of light was determined using a Ref101N-min 60° glossmeter
(Sheen Instruments, England). The water resistance of TOWPU coatings
was expressed by a water absorption measurement. The TOWPU
coating films were cut into 20 mm × 20 mm pieces which were dried at
60 °C for 24 h. The cut pieces were soaked in deionized water at room
temperature for 24 h, and then remove to absorb the surface water of

could not distinctly influence the grain size and viscosity of waterborne
polyurethanes [20]. However, too much nanoTiO would mean losing
the characters of nanoparticles. These nanoTiO showed aggregation in
the waterborne polyurethane matrix, and they either clad outside of
waterborme polyurethane emulsion particles or independently dis
persed in waterborne polyurethanes (Fig. 2). Consequently, the grain
size and viscosity sharply increased with the addition of nanoTiO [15].

And the zeta potential was the potential difference between the sliding

As can be seen in Table 1, the tensile strength increased from
the nanoTiOz improved tensile strength because anatase nanoTiO was
able to lhomogeneously disperse in two-component waterborme poly-
urethanes and break the stress concentration caused by inorganic rigid
particles to provide a wide interface to reinforoe marix [13,25]. In
addition,  SOF persisted as  CH;CHSO, in polyurethane chain to
increase hard segment content. Although tensile strength of the films

tensile strength was due to aggregation of too much nanoTiO, Fig. 2c
and d). NanoTiO clad outside of emulsion particles or independently
dispersed in waterborne polyurethanes to weakene the interfacial in-
teraction between nanoTiOg and two-component waterborme poly-
urethanes [26,27]. Meanwhile, the hydroxide radical of the hydroxyl
component reacted with the isocyanato of the hydrophilic curing agent
to create chemical croslinking to harden materials, which promoted
strong acing force among hard segments that was beneficial for forming
lamella or microcrystalline structure. All results of the above factors
improved tensile strength simultaneously. The fracture elongation was
weakened with the adlition of nanoTiO because hydrophilic nanoTiO
could incorporate with two-component waterborme polyurethanes by
chemical bond. It created a chemical crosslinking network to enhance
the interaction among two-component waterborne polyurethane chains
[28,29]. As a result, it was hard to produce relative slippage of the
macromolecule chains by extemal force, which caused the decline of
fracture elongation.
3.3. Thermal behevior
From Fig. 3, the thermal degradation of TOWPU coatings was di-
vided into four stages: 180°C245 °C, 245 °C324°C, 324°C391 °C,
and 391 °C480 °C. And relative parameters were listed in Table 2. The
falling and the maximum degradation speed (Vnas) increased after
initial degradation temperature (Te) of the fist stage increased, before
falling (the inflexion was at 1.0% content of hydrophilic nanoTiO).
Meanwhile, the maximum degradation temperature (Taax) of this stage
declined with the addition of hydrophilic nanoTiO,. It meant that some

heat-resisting and degradation resistant material, which had out-
three explanations for this. Firstly, nanoTiO itself was an inorganic,

of the polymer. Altermatively, nanoTiO could incorporate with wa-

bond. At last, the crolinking network could have become denser with
more nanoTiO2, and restrained the molecular chain movement of
polyurethane. Hence the movement and degradation of molecular chain

which could have played a role in cladding the waterbome poly-
urethane to obstruct the products of volatile gases during the polymer
degradation and reduced outside transport pathways. Finally, the last
stage showed an obvious change of Vzex with the addition of nanoTiO
[17,29,32]. It declined to below 0.0036 °C/min, which was much lower
than TOWPU-0. The thermal degradation speed retarded because of the
new crosslinking network caused by nanoTiO [33,34]. Meanwhile, the
synergistic effect between the SO and phosphate groups produced at
the second stage could accelerate the products of carbon layers and
prohibit the growth of energy [28,35].

structure of the released gases, which was illustrated in Fig. 4b and
(2365 cm ~). The characteristic absorption peak of sulfonate radical
was at 1051 cm. At 250 °C (Fig. 4b), ether bond and O were at
1117 cm 2 and 1047 cm respectively. It meant that the stage was
decomposed to release SO, CO and HCN. At 350 °C (Fig. 4b), the
characteristic absorption peak of methyl or methylene groups appeared
[uoqes pue OH  jo suopdosqe aL °; _u 98   _u 067 woj
was at 2802 cm ~ and 1724 cm ~. The ether bond of ketone, aldehyde
and ether was obvious at 1109 cm *? meaning it occurred at the de-
composition of the hard-segment and chemical crosslinking segment,
The characteristic absorption peak of NHa appeared at 926 cm
which meant that the hard-segment product would continually de.
compose to inert gases. From Fig. 4b, 450 °C represented the fourth
thermal decomposition (from 392 °C to 480 °C). As noted in Table 3, the
characteristic absorption peak which occurred between 2972 cm  and
2875 cm   was methyl or methylene groups. Carbonyl stretching vi-
bration occurred at 1720 cm while the characteristic absorption peak
of ether bond occurred at 1075 cm~ 1. These results suggest that at that
stage ketone and ether were created, which would have derived from
the thermal decomposition of the soft-segment and polyether or poly-
ether polyhydric alcohols., Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption

no gas release, which meant the decomposition had completed.

COO  was at 1450 cm ~. The phosphate was decomposed at 250°C
because the absorption peak of P-OH could be seen at 1709 cm ~′. The
stretching vibration of carbamate (1731 cm~1) and C O C
(1227 cm~2), and the flexural vibration of NH (1536 cm1) had
weakened. Meanwhile, the symmetry and dissymmetry stretching vi
bration absorption peaks of  SO, were still seen at that time, but they
were weaker due to the decomposition of  SO3 [36], which was in
accordance with TGA. The formation of carbon layers was in con-
formity with TGA and TGA-FTIR (Figs. 3 and 4). At 350°C, phosphoric
acid was further formed polyphosphoric acid through polycondensa-
tion. The formation of SO (the decomposed production of  SO,) and
polyphosphoric acid could catalyze the decomposition of segmersto
form carbon layers (1630 cm1). At 450°C, the COC of the soft-
segment of TOWPU was weakened at 1100 cm, which signified the
complete decomposition of hard segments. It was consistent with TGA
and TGA-FTIR (Figs. 3 and 4). The strong absorptions of P = O,
P  O C and P  C were at 1256 cm ~, 990 cm ~2 and 753 cm ~ re-
spectively. Besides, the symmetric absorption peak of P-O-P derived
from the decomposition of phosphate was at 1110 cm1 [36,37]. The
peak of P-O-P verified the existence of polyphosphoester in TOWPU
during decomposition. When warmed at 50o °C, there were only the

position. Firstly, neutralization chain segments depredated to produce
sulfonate radical and organic phosphate of TOWPU started between
227 °C to 318 °C to produce SO and phosphate groups (phosphoric acid
and polyphosphoric acid). Thirdly, the thermal degradation of the hard-
segment of the hydroxyl component and the chemical croslinking

tion of the stage to produce polyetber main chains and volatilize non-
phosphate groups created by the second stage promoted the degrada-
flammable gases such as CO, HCN and NH, Finally, the thermal de-
gradation of the soft-segment of the hydroxyl component and polyether
segment derived from the hydrophilic curing agent from between
392 °C to 480 °C. Polyether main chains created carbon by phosphate
groups (phosphoric acid and polyphosphoric acid) and were decom
posed to produce micromolecular ether, ketone and aldehyde.
Meanwhile, residual hard-segments and chemical crosslinking chains
were further decomposed to NH, [3840].

the addition of hydrophilic nanoTiO, which meant better flame re-
tardant. A higher amount of hydrophilic nanoTiO, accelerated the
production of carbon layers. The LOI value was the most important
index for measuring the material flame retardant performance [17,32].
A high LOI value meant that materials could not be fired. As seen in
Table 4, the LO1 value of TowPU was over 29.0%, indicating that
TOWPU were nonflammable [17]. The reason was that P-C bond firstly
fractured due to its low bonding energy during combustion. Meanwhile,
finally formative poly (metaphosphoric acid) acted as the catalysis of
nonflammable carbon layers covered the surface of polymer to barrier

could produce a larger unbroken carbon surface and layers, which was
in accordance with TGA. The cladding layer controlled energetic
growth which declined energy density and prevented surface heat

Therefore hydrophilic nanoTiO accelerated the condensed phase

From Fig 7a, TOWPU-0 had certain anti-ultraviolet fumctions be-

dis-conjugation and carbanyl chromophores with n electronics (be-
region (from 200 nm to 400 nm). The UV shielding effect obviously
increased from 200 nm to 400 nm by adding nanoTiO,. Near the UV
light region, there was an anti-UV phenomenon, which could delay
aging of TOWPU films. The reason for this was that the grain size in-
creased with the addition of nanoTiO and caused the high refractive
index to weaken absorption and reflectivity of ultraviolet rays [35].
Meanwhile, the peak showed a blue shift because there were large
numbers of conjugate chromophore carbonyl groups which influenced
the location of the absorption peak. In combination, TOWPU could
induce, absorb and reflect ultraviolet with nanoTiO> In the region of

4.Conclusioms
The TOwPU showed nice stability. The nanoTiO could effectively
improve tensile strength and inhibit the decomposition of TOWPU. A
greater component of hydrophilic nanoTiO could produce a larger
unbroken carbon yield surface and thicker carbon layers. Besides, the
LOl and UL-94 testing results showed that all the TOWPU coatings
reached over 29.4% and V.0 level respectively. There was an anti-UV
phenomenon, which could delay the aging of films afer
nanoTiO. By adding nanoTiO, the water absorption decreased from
adding
29.3% to 16.3%, With the adition of nanoTiO2, the solvent resistance
of TOWPU became exceptional. Combing with emulsion properties,
