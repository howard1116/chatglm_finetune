1.Introductiot
As a consequence of the increasingly strict environmental legislation
and the concern about human health, waterborne polyurethane (WPU)
has become one of the most investigated materials in the past decade
(Philipp and Eschig, 2012). As an excellent replacement of the solvent
based polyurethanes (PUs), WPU exhibits a wide range of advantages.
Above all, wWPU contains zero or low volatile organic compound (VOC)
since water is used as dispersant in these PU products, while solvent PU
contains more than 600 g/L of VOC (Burja et al., 2015). Moreover,
WPUs avoid combustion or blast in the process of preparation, storage,
transportation and painting, meeting the urgent requirement of safety
as well as environmental protection. Additionally, several excellent
outstanding abrasion resistance etc. (Gurunathan et al., 2013), enabling
performances are observed for WPU, such as flexibility, good strength,

(DMBA) are typical commercial available emulsifiers used in anionic
Dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), and dimethylol butanoic acid
PUDs. Their OH groups are more reactive than the COOH group due to
the steric effect, resulting in the preferential reactivity between OH
groups and isocyanates to form long PU chains while the COOH groups
provide surface charge after neutralization and stabilize PUDs in the
water phase (Chen et al., 2014). Many research groups have used DMPA
or DMBA as emulsifiers for WPUs due to the outstanding mechanical
properties of the resulting films. Philipp et al. prepared a series of wPUs
derived from rapeseed fatty acid methyl esters with 1.35.0 wt%
DMPA. Their results demonstrated that increasing DMPA content de-
creases the particle size of the PUDs but also reduces the hydro-
phobicity of the films (Philipp and Eschig, 2012). Lee et al. synthesized
WPUs from polytetramethylene ether glycols with 2  3 wt% DMBA,
which exhibit tensile strength from 6.5 to 10.5 MPa (Lee and Kim,
2009). Lee and his co-workers compared the properties of the WPUs
from three kinds of polycarbonatediols with various carboxylic diols,
including DMPA, DMBA and carboxylic polycaprolactonediol (L4672,
L6002, and L5652). They found that the similar particle sizes were
observed for both the PUDs from DMBA and DMPA, but the former
films exhibit a higher tensile strength and a lower elongation at break

can react with isocyanates directly without further modification
(Nguyen Dang et al., 2016). The specific bydrophobic triglyeride
structure of castor oil can also improve the mechanical properties,
et al., 2013). Luong et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of castor

mechanical properties of the PU films can be tailored by controlling the
ratios between castor oil, poly(dimethylsiloxane) and poly(tetra-
hydrofuran), which were both used as soft segments in the polymer
preparation (Nguyen Dang et al., 2016). The castor oil based anionic
WPU prepared by Xia et al. exhibits a relatively high tensile strength of
13 MPa and elongation at break of 336% (Xia and Larock, 2011).
Gurunathan and Chung successfully synthesized a series of WPU na-
nocomposites from castor oil with 0  5 wt% silicon. The results show
that the film without silicon also bas a considerably low water ab-

films. In this study, castor oil-based WPUs were synthesized with two
emulsifiers (DMPA and DMBA) and a variable ratio between the OH
groups in CO, the NCO groups in IPDI, and the OH groups in the
emulsifier (1:1.7:0.69; 1:1.85:0.84; 1:2:0.99; 1:2.2:1.19). Centrifuge

3. 1. Difference in reactivip' of the ewulsifiers
The reaction between NCO group and DMBA exhibits a higher rate
than that between NCO group and DMPA. It takes about 15 min for the
prepolymerization with DMBA to reach the gel point before the addi-
tion of the MEK, while it takes about 1 h for the systems with DMPA.
Two main factors are associated with the difference in reaction rate. On
one hand, the higher melting point and lower solubility (MEK) of DMPA
(7 = 185190 °C; 20 °C, S(DMPA) = 0.4 g/100 g MEK) than DMBA
(Tx = 108113°C; 20 °C, S(DMBA) = 7 g/100 g MEK) leads to a lower
collision rate between DMPA and isocyanate (Fermandes et al., 2015;
KosheelaDevi et al., 2016). On the other hand, the extra methylene
(-CH-) in the side chain of DMBA decreases the steric hindrance for the 
reactions between its OH groups and NCO groups in IPDI (the structural
formula of DMPA and DMBA are shown in Fig. 1).

of emulsifier were used. For example, when the hydroxyl molar ratio of
emulsifer is 1.19, the particle sizes of the PUDs from DMPA and DMBA
are 185.9 and 20.5 nm, respectively. It is well known that the WPU
prepolymer has to be neutralized to form bydrophilic intemmal salt be-
fore dispersion. The larger steric hindrance of DMPA lowers the re
activity of COOH group, resulting in lower neutralization degree of the
PUDs from DMPA than those from DMBA when same usage of TEA was
employed. The lower neutralization degree of the PUDs from DMPA
leads to fewer counter ions (COO“) which results in a thinner elec-
trical double layer around each PUD particle. The thinner electrical
double layer reduces the electrostatic repulsive forces between the PUD
particles, resulting in larger particle size,
the color and transparency of them accordingly becomes lighter and

are 61° and 23.25’, respectively). These results arise from the slightly
high castor oil content of the films from DMPA, which contains hy-

0.69DMPA has the lowest water contact angle, resulting from the
lowest cross-linking density (see Table 4) (Chen et al., 2016). Further-
more, the increase in emulsifier molar ratio leads to the reduction in
water and ethanol contact angle of the samples. As emulsifier molar
ratio changes from 0.69 to 1.19, the water contact angle of the film
from DMBA gradually decrease from 66.63° to 61’, and ethanol contact
angle decrease from 28.88" to 23.25'. Because as the emulsifier molar
ratio increases, the bydrophilic COOH group content of the films in-
creases and the hydrophobic CO content decreases, resulting in the
improvement of the hydrophilicity of the films.

angles demonstrated. The samples from DMBA have higher water ab-
sorption than those from DMPA. PU-1.19DMBA exhibits water ab-
sorption of 31.06%, while the water absorption of PU-1.19DMPA is
30.25%, This result is related to the lower hydrophobic castor oil
content and the lower cross-linking density of the films from DMBA as
mentioned above (Gao et al., 2015). The higher cross-linking density
makes the molecular chains more compacted, resulting in more difficult
for water to enter the interior of the films (Yu et al., 2016). Hence, the
water absoeption of PU-0.69DMPA is higher than that of PU-0.69DMBA
due to the lower cross-linking density of the former. Moreover, the
water absorption of the films increases with the rise of emulsifier
content due to the reduction of hydrophobic CO content and the in-
crease of hydrophilic COOH groups. In detail, with the DMPA molar
ratios increasing from 0.69 to 1.19, the water absorptions of PU films
increase from 13.30 to 30.25%.
